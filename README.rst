==========

StoDynProg is a Python tool to help solving *stochastic optimal control*
problems, also called *dynamic optimization*.

It implements some algorithms of Dynamic Programming to solve such problems
(Value Iteration, Policy Iteration algorithms)
and most importantly provides an API to describe the optimization problem.
(see `doc/` for more details and examples)
